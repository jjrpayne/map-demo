# map-demo
This is a map demo for a coding challenge by Foundry Spatial.

The map demo consists of two parts:

1 - [An API that returns the coordinates of a point-of-interest.](https://github.com/jjrpayne/poi-api)
2 - A single-page web app that makes a request to the API and shows the coordinates on a map (this application)

The web app can be seen at https://jjrpayne.github.io/map-demo/.
The application was deployed via Github pages.
